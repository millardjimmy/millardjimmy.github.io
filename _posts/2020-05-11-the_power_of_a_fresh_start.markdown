I think the best advice I have ever been given was from a sailor in Maine. We were in the annual schooner gam, he and I were having our rum in a rowboat enjoying our view or a dozen tallships as the sun was setting. While discussing traveling the world and chasing happiness, he told me to "just start walkin'". I drunkenly reminded him that we were actually in a rowboat and that idea was stupid.

What he eventually explained was that the way he saw things, if there's an chance to do something, especially if the chance doesn't create problems, he will absolutely start walkin'. No questions asked.

As a result, he (ironically enough) traveled by foot on the Apalachian Trail once a year, finding work either in Maine or in Georgia. He was able to regale me with stories night after night with stories that he had collected by never "being too busy to just start walkin' "

My salary when in 2013 was 160$ per week, by 2019 it was 1,100 per week. This was an incredible feat in my eyes but still, I was supporting a large family and it just wasn't cutting it. For my entire professional life, I was either a sailor or a truck driver. I was never afraid to move to a new place or start a new job. Thanks to Covid-19, I had some time to think: **What are you doing? How are you going to retire? WHAT DIFFERENCE HAVE YOU MADE** 

You can imagine how vulnerable I felt, I want to do right by my family, by my community. Maybe Software Engineering is the start of making a difference.
