You know, when I watched instructors though together a working CLI gem in less than two hours, I thought "hey! I've got a whole week to figure this out!" 

Boy, did I need it! I ended up with starting over a few times, until I settled on a book ranker...reader. And though this school has prepared many students to tackle this 100% solo, I still relied a lot on my fellow students! Every one of them more helpful than the next. But while I could talk about how awesome these folks are, let's pivot and talk about process.

I started this project like I do with many others I've started, by wireframing(making a plan visually). And while I did end up with four wireframes done, the last one was the simplest. I had to ask myself, who was I trying to reach? the answer: curious readers. They want a small synopsis of a book before reading it, and I can provide that by offering up this simple text-based adventure. 

My program scrapes a pretty simplistic website, that parsed the page for book names, authors, and summaries. it's simple, yet scalable. In the future I plan on making it operate on a much larger level. anyway, from the information scraped, the user can see a list of 50 books and choose to read a summary of each. Like I said, simple. if anything, it's a good building block to help me concieve of more complicated end-products.

And I look forwad to it very much.
