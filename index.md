## Who I am
Hi, I'm Jimmy.
- ### I [blog](./blog/blog-home.html) about art and design.
- ### Keep my [resume](./resume.html) nice n' tidy.
- ### And showcase some of my [projects](./projects.html).

I'm an artist, designer, and developer.

## What I do
While not working on design things, you'll probably find me painting [simple beers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/keeping-it-simple-with-smash-brewing/), playing [board](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars)/[card](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull)/[tabletop](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster)/[RP](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/)/video games, or fishing! Would also love to chat about any of these, as well.
